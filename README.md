project:
  name: "Robust Text Classification"
  categories: ["sports", "politics", "tech", "food", "entertainment"]
  description: >
    A robust text classification project that predicts whether a sentence
    belongs to sports, politics, tech, food, or entertainment. It is designed
    to handle noisy, real-world text containing slang, emojis, typos, and
    random capitalization. Includes a Streamlit UI for live predictions.
  license: "MIT"

features:
  - text normalization:
      - lowercasing
      - de-duplication of characters (e.g. speeech ‚Üí speech)
      - emoji-to-word mapping (üçî ‚Üí burger, üé¨ ‚Üí movie, üî• ‚Üí fire)
      - slang expansion (2day ‚Üí today, smh ‚Üí disappointed, lol ‚Üí funny)
      - enrichment of political keywords (pm ‚Üí prime minister, election, parliament)
  - feature extraction:
      - word-level TF-IDF n-grams
      - character-level TF-IDF n-grams
  - model:
      type: "Stacked Ensemble"
      base_learners:
        - "Calibrated Linear SVC"
        - "Complement Naive Bayes"
        - "SGD Logistic Regression"
      meta_learner: "Logistic Regression"
  - evaluation:
      - group-wise splitting to prevent data leakage
      - clean accuracy: "~75%"
      - macro f1: "~0.82"
      - noisy robustness accuracy: "~74%"
  - ui:
      framework: "Streamlit"
      capability: "Interactive live predictions with confidence scores"
